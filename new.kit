        <h1>Leander</h1>
        <article>
          Then dreadful thoughts of death, of waves heaped on him. And friends,
          and parting daylight, rush upon him. He thinks of prayers to Neptune
          and his daughters. And Venus, Hero's queen, sprung from the waters;
          And then of Hero only,—how she fares. And what she'll feel, when the
          blank morn appears; And at that thought he stiffens once again. His
          limbs, and pants, and strains, and climbs,—in vain. Fierce draughts he
          swallows of the wilful wave.

        <h1>Brutus</h1>
        <article>
          Men at some time are masters of their fates: The fault, dear Brutus,
          is not in our stars, But in ourselves, that we are underlings.

        <h1>Observer</h1>
        <article>
          They flee from me that sometime did me seek With naked foot stalking
          in my chamber. I have seen them gentle tame and meek That now are wild
          and do not remember That sometime they put themselves in danger To
          take bread at my hand; and now they range Busily seeking with a
          continual change.

        <article>
          What you think, you become. What you feel, you attract. What you
          imagine, you create.

        <h1>The Shark</h1>
        <article>
          When I was a little boy there was a small, rectangular painting on the
          wall next to my parents bedroom: a painting of a shark, and we all
          simply called it "The Shark", or "Hajen" in swedish. Somehow, within
          the family it gained somewhat of a cult status. We all loved the way
          the light traveled through the surface of the water, the detail of the
          animal and the angle from where it was painted. For others it was
          merely just a painting, but for us... it was an artwork of pride:
          being my father's painting.
