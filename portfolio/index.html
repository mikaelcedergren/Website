      <h1>Lanefinder</h1>
      <p
        >Lanefinder is aimed towards truckers in the trucking industry with over
        5,000+ jobs and 7,000+ customers advertising on this platform, achieved
        within just two years.</p
      >
      <p
        >I designed the visual expression of this brand and have been the Art
        Director for every product that stem from Lanefinder. Market material,
        the app, the website and much more. Since Lanefinder is a new player on
        the market I wanted the brand to convey attitude and uniqueness, hence
        the slighly more feminine color scheme. I also took inspiration from
        road signage and work with the colors in a similar way. Clarity,
        uniqueness and attitude was the feel I went for.</p

        >The YouCruit brand needed a more substantial nudge in branding, so I
        came up with Geophrey. Which is a robot meant to symbolise to the
        underlying artifical intelligence of the system, while introducing some
        charm and make the brand more rememberable.</p

        was applying to a web design position. As she told me the brief, this is
        what popped into my mind. Within 24 hours I've created an entire brand
        and had a blast doing it.</p

    <h1>Motion Graphics Showreel</h1>
    <p
      >Worked as a Motion Designer for SVT, the public broadcaster of Sweden and
      this is a showreel of my works there. But be kind, this was a long time
      ago and have grown substantially since.</p
    >
    <p
      >However, with that said, my work has been seen by millions. And I have
      exceptional pride in creating the idea for "På Spåret" where I wanted to
      create an intro based on toy trains, but at the same time making it as
      realistic as possible. My original intro has since been replaced, but to
      this day the idea I had lives on.</p
