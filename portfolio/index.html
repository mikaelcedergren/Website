      <h1>Lanefinder</h1>
      <pre>Truck Driver Recruitment</pre>
      <p
        >Lanefinder, tailored specifically for truckers in the trucking industry, has swiftly established itself as a powerhouse within just two years. With an impressive roster of over 5,000+ job listings and a loyal customer base exceeding 7,000+, this platform has made its mark.</p
      >
      <p
        >As the Art Director behind Lanefinder, I had the privilege of shaping its visual identity across a range of products. From crafting market materials to designing the app and website, my creative touch has been embedded in every aspect. Recognizing the need for a distinct brand image, I infused Lanefinder with attitude and uniqueness. To achieve this, I opted for a slightly more feminine color scheme, drawing inspiration from road signage and utilizing colors in a harmonious and eye-catching manner. The result: a brand that exudes clarity, individuality, and a compelling attitude.</p
      >
      <p>Throughout the design process, my goal was to ensure that Lanefinder stands out as a new player in the market. By combining clarity, uniqueness, and attitude, I aimed to create an unmistakable impression that resonates with both truckers and industry professionals alike.</p>

      <pre>Design & Geophrey the Mascot</pre>
      <p
        > During my time at YouCruit, an Applicant Tracking System that initially emerged in Sweden and expanded its presence to the US, I contributed to various creative aspects. I had the opportunity to engage in design, videography, explainers, logo development, and more.</p
      >
      <p
        >Recognizing the need for an enhanced brand identity, I created and introduced Geophrey, a robot character that represents the underlying artificial intelligence of the system. Geophrey added a touch of charm and increased the brand's memorability.</p
      ><p
        >Geophrey's versatility allowed him to complement numerous projects. He has appeared in explainer videos, animated iconography, and other creative endeavors. By dressing Geophrey in different outfits, he seamlessly aligns with any concept or idea, adding a unique touch to the content I produce and further reinforcing the YouCruit brand.</p

      <pre>Book Cover</pre>
      <p
        >I had the opportunity to design a book cover for a romance novel written by Ola Hasselgren. This heartfelt story revolves around two characters and their dramatic love affair. A notable aspect of the narrative is the presence of a pilot, which adds an intriguing element to the plot.</p
      >
      <p>With the aim of capturing the essence of the characters' emotional journey, I carefully crafted a book cover that visually represents the intensity and passion of their relationship.

      >Nonetheless, it brings me great joy to share that my work has reached millions of viewers. I take exceptional pride in conceptualizing the idea for "På Spåret," where I aimed to create an engaging intro using toy trains, while maintaining a sense of realism. Although my original intro has since been replaced, I am honored to see that other graphic artists have followed my concept, keeping its essence alive to this day.</p
