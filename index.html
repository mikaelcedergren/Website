                      <h3>Leander</h3>
                      <p>Then dreadful thoughts of death, of waves heaped on him.<br />
                        And friends, and parting daylight, rush upon him.<br />
                        He thinks of prayers to Neptune and his daughters.<br />
                        And Venus, Hero's queen, sprung from the waters;<br />
                        And then of Hero only,—how she fares.<br />
                        And what she'll feel, when the blank morn appears;<br />
                        And at that thought he stiffens once again<br />
                        His limbs, and pants, and strains, and climbs,—in vain.<br />
                        Fierce draughts he swallows of the wilful wave.</p>

                      <h3>Tribute</h3>
                      <p>
                        Now, this is a special case. It's entirely dedicated to honor my father, and
                        even though it's not my normal style... I couldn't bare to remove it.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        When I was a little boy there was a small, rectangular painting on the wall
                        next to my parents bedroom: a painting of a shark, and we all simply called
                        it "The Shark", or "Hajen" in swedish.
                      </p>
                    
                      <p>
                        Somehow, within the family it gained somewhat of a cult status. We all loved
                        the way the light traveled through the surface of the water, the detail of
                        the animal and the angle from where it was painted. For others it was merely
                        just a painting, but for us... it was an artwork of pride: being my father's
                        painting.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Unfortunately he's now gone, and "Hajen" is no longer with me. So I decided
                        to honor my father and make my own.
                      </p>
                      <p>This is my tribute to my father; a real man and my biggest inspiration.</p>
