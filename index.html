      <h1>Lanefinder</h1>
      <pre>Truck Driver Recruitment Platform</pre>
      <p
        >Lanefinder, tailored specifically for truckers in the trucking industry, has swiftly established itself as a powerhouse within just two years. With an impressive roster of over 5,000+ job listings and a loyal customer base exceeding 7,000+, this platform has made its mark.</p
      >
      <p
        >As the Art Director behind Lanefinder, I had the privilege of shaping its complete visual identity. Recognizing the need for a distinct brand image, my aim was to infuse Lanefinder with attitude and uniqueness. To achieve this, I opted for a slightly more feminine color scheme and drawing inspiration from typical American road signage.</p

      <h1>YouCruit</h1>
      <pre>Applicant Tracking System & Geophrey the Mascot</pre>
      <p
        > During my time at YouCruit, an Applicant Tracking System that initially emerged in Sweden and later expanded its presence to the US, I contributed to various creative aspects. I engaged in design, videography, explainers, logo development, and more.</p
      >
      <p
        >Recognizing the need for an enhanced brand identity, I created and introduced Geophrey, a robot character that represents the underlying artificial intelligence of the system. He has appeared in explainer videos, animated iconography, and other creative productions. By dressing Geophrey in different outfits, he aligns with any concept or idea, and further reinforcing the YouCruit brand.</p

    <pre>Motion Graphics Showreel</pre>
    <p
      >I had the privilege of working as a Motion Designer at SVT, the public broadcaster of Sweden. This showreel showcases some of my past works during my time there.

    <p
      >I especially take pride in conceptualizing the idea for "På Spåret" of filming toy trains, while obviously faking a sense of realism.
