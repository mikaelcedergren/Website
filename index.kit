    Now, this is a special case. It's entirely dedicated to honor my father, and
    even though it's not my normal style... I couldn't bare to remove it.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I was a little boy there was a small, rectangular painting on the wall
    next to my parents bedroom: a painting of a shark, and we all simply called
    it "The Shark", or "Hajen" in swedish.
  </p>

  <p>
    Somehow, within the family it gained somewhat of a cult status. We all loved
    the way the light traveled through the surface of the water, the detail of
    the animal and the angle from where it was painted. For others it was merely
    just a painting, but for us... it was an artwork of pride: being my father's
    painting.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately he's now gone, and "Hajen" is no longer with me. So I decided
    to honor my father and make my own.
  </p>
  <p>This is my tribute to my father; a real man and my biggest inspiration.</p> -->
