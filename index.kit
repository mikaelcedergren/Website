        Lanefinder, a job board tailored specifically for truckers in the
        trucking industry, has swiftly established itself as a powerhouse within
        just two years. With an impressive roster of over 5,000+ job listings
        and a loyal customer base exceeding 7,000+, this platform has made its
        mark.

    <h4>Context</h4>
    <p
      >To establish a noticeable presence in the trucking industry, the brand
      needed to stand out, convey an appealing attitude to attract its target
      audience, and communicate a unique identity that differentiates it from
      competitors.
    </p>
    <h4>Solution</h4>
    <p>
      I researched the competition and chose a more feminine color scheme,
      inspired by traditional American road signage, to make the brand relatable
      to the target audience while helping it stand out.</p
    >
    <h4>Outcome</h4>
    <p
      >The response was overwhelming â€“ within just a year, Lanefinder became a
      trusted and distinct resource, with truck driver schools regularly
      recommending it as a reliable job board with a unique touch.</p
    >

  <article>
    <h4>Context</h4>
    <p
      >The website acted as the main advertising platform and included uniquely
      designed landing pages. It was essential in helping users start their job
      search and connect with our services.
    </p>
    <h4>Purpose</h4>
    <p
      >The aim was to guide drivers into our app to improve user retention and
      offer features that benefit both Lanefinder and users, particularly
      through notifications to keep users engaged. This engagement would not
      have been possible if the platform existed only on the web, as mobile apps
      provide unique opportunities for retention and user interaction.</p
    >
    <h4>Solution</h4>
    <p>
      I positioned the account registration step at the end of the application
      process to leverage the user's commitment. We also sent follow-up emails
      and messages to encourage users to download the app, emphasizing benefits
      like increased visibility of their applications to employers.</p

  <img src="images/portfolio/lanefinder-app-screens.png" />
  <article>
    <h4>Context</h4>
    <p
      >In the trucking industry, drivers need to find specific jobs due to
      strict regulations, making it challenging for job search platforms to
      offer enough value to become the go-to option.</p
    >
    <h4>Solution</h4>
    <p
      >I tackled this by incorporating detailed filters into the design, helping
      drivers avoid wasting time on jobs they weren't qualified for due to
      regulations. The app also kept them updated on their application's
      progress and gently guided them to take actions that benefited both them
      and us.</p
    >
  </article>
  <img src="images/portfolio/lanefinder-application-flow.png" />
  <article>
    <h4>Context</h4>
    <p
      >Most communication with drivers occurred through the app, Lanefinder's
      main platform. The challenge was that the trucking industry requires a
      detailed application with hundreds of fields, which can be tedious,
      especially for a new job board. Building trust takes time, and this
      complexity can hinder user engagement.
    </p>
    <h4>Solution</h4>
    <p
      >I addressed this by simplifying the application process into a
      pre-qualification stage. Once a driver received interest from a company,
      Lanefinder sent automated emails and notifications encouraging them to
      complete their profile. This approach is similar to building commitment in
      a poker game; by asking for minimal information initially, I guided users
      to where I wanted them to go.</p
    >
    <p
      >This method gave companies key information about the driver upfront, and
      eventually, they received a full profile that met DOT and insurance
      requirements.</p
    >
    <h4>Outcome</h4>
    <p
      >My strategy significantly increased job applications, growing from just a
      few to thousands each month. In addition, both surveys Lanefinder
      conducted showed genuine appreciation for its design and user-friendly
      flow.</p

    <h4>Context</h4>
    <p
      >A clear brand identity was essential for quickly connecting jobs to our
      clients and making a significant impact on our target market to build a
      regular customer base. Additionally, time was critical; we needed to
      disrupt the stagnant practices that have long characterized the trucking
      industry.
    </p>
    <p
      >Establishing a strong brand not only helps differentiate us from
      competitors but also builds trust and recognition among potential
      customers, which is vital for fostering loyalty and driving business
      growth in this competitive landscape.</p
    >
    <h4>Solution</h4>
    <p
      >To address the challenge of developing a clear message that stood out
      among the competition and supported Lanefinder's Unique Selling
      Proposition, I crafted a distinctive message that effectively communicated
      the brand's value to truckers.
    </p>
    <p
      >Additionally, I established marketing asset libraries in Figma for both
      marketing and development, ensuring brand consistency across all media and
      platforms. This approach not only made it easy for truckers to instantly
      recognize Lanefinder's communications but also streamlined the development
      process, allowing teams to work more efficiently while reinforcing a
      cohesive brand identity.</p

    Recognizing the need for an enhanced brand identity, I created and

    artificial intelligence of the system. He has appeared in explainer videos,
