        Lanefinder, a job board tailored specifically for truckers in the
        trucking industry, has swiftly established itself as a powerhouse within
        just two years. With an impressive roster of over 5,000+ job listings
        and a loyal customer base exceeding 7,000+, this platform has made its
        mark.

    <h4>Context</h4>
    <p
      >Being a new player in the trucking industry, the brand needed to be
      noticable, have attitude that attracted the target audience and a clear
      sense of uniqueness.
    </p>
    <h4>Solution</h4>
    <p>
      To achieve this, I opted for a slightly more feminine color scheme and
      using the colors in a reminiscent way of typical american road signage.</p
    >
    <h4>Outcome</h4>
    <p
      >The response was overwhelming â€“ within just a year, Lanefinder became a
      trusted and distinct resource, with truck driver schools regularly
      recommending it as a reliable job board with a unique touch.</p
    >

  <article>
    <h4>Context</h4>
    <p
      >As the main page for advertising and a distinctively designed landing
      pages, the website played a crucial role - especially since the website
      served as a pathway for users to begin their job search.
    </p>
    <h4>Purpose</h4>
    <p
      >To funnel drivers into the app to gain more leverage, user retainment and
      being able to provide beneficial features, where notifications was a big
      part.</p
    >
    <h4>Solution</h4>
    <p>
      When applying through the website, I placed the registration process for
      creating an account at the end, leveraging the psychological commitment
      built throughout the job application. Then, users were enticed into the
      app through emails and messages, with clear incentives such as having
      their application viewed by companies.</p

  <article>
    <h4>Context</h4>
    <p
      >In the trucking industry, drivers need to find specific jobs due to
      strict regulations, making it challenging to offer enough value to become
      the go-to job search platform.</p
    >
    <h4>Solution</h4>
    <p
      >I tackled this by focusing on our detailed filters, so drivers would
      realize to not waste time on jobs they weren't qualified for due to the
      regulations. The app also let us keep them updated on their application's
      progress and gently guided them toward actions that benefited both them
      and us, such as edging them towards supplying more information.</p
    >
  </article>
  <img src="images/portfolio/lanefinder-application-flow.png" />
  <article>
    <h4>Context</h4>
    <p
      >Most communication with drivers went through the app, Lanefinder's main
      platform. The challenge was that the trucking industry requires a detailed
      application with hundreds of fields to fill out, which can be tedious,
      especially for a new job board - trust takes time to build.
    </p>
    <h4>Solution</h4>
    <p
      >I addressed this by simplifying the application process into a
      pre-qualification stage. Once a driver received interest from a company,
      send automated emails and notifications encouraging them to complete their
      profile. Why? Because just like a poker game you have to build up
      commitment to lead a user where you want them to go. So I chose to ask as
      little as possible, while still providing value to the clients, and then
      patch the secondary information though value propositions to the user.</p
    >
    <p
      >This approach provided companies with key information about the driver
      upfront, and eventually, they received a full profile, meeting DOT and
      insurance requirements.</p
    >
    <h4>Outcome</h4>
    <p
      >This strategy significantly increased job applications, growing from just
      a few to thousands each month. In addition, both surveys Lanefinder
      conducted showed genuine appreciation for its design and user-friendly
      flow.</p

    <h4>Context</h4>
    <p
      >A clear brand identity was crucial for quickly funneling jobs to our
      clients and making a notable impact on our target market to build a
      regular customer base. Also, time was of the essence - we needed to
      unbreak the stagnated way the trucking industry was handled.</p
    >
    <h4>Solution</h4>
    <p
      >To address the challenge of developing a clear message that stood out
      among the competition and supported Lanefinder's Unique Selling
      Proposition, I crafted a distinctive message that effectively communicated
      the brand's value to truckers. Additionally, I established marketing asset
      libraries in Figma for both marketing and development, ensuring brand
      consistency across all materials. This approach not only made it easy for
      truckers to instantly recognize Lanefinder's communications but also
      streamlined the development process, allowing teams to work more
      efficiently while reinforcing a cohesive brand identity.</p

    in different outfits, he aligns with any concept or idea, and further
    reinforcing the YouCruit brand.
