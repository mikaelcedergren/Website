      I highly recommend Mikael for any creative role as he truly excels as an
      art director and designer. Mikael's talent and creativity in the field of
      art direction are truly remarkable. With an impeccable eye for detail and
      a strong sense of aesthetics, Mikael consistently delivers visually
      stunning and innovative designs. His ability to translate ideas into
      captivating visuals is truly impressive. Furthermore, as a co-worker,
      Mikael is an absolute pleasure to collaborate with, he's a fantastic
      mentor and I have learnt so much while working with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mikael's dedication, professionalism, and ability to lead a team make him
      an invaluable asset to any creative endeavour.
    </p>

      This man knows his craft inside out, and makes what he does look easy. I
      assure you, it is not!
    </p>
    <p>
      As luck would have it, Mikael is not just a very competent designer, but a
      great colleague as well. He always comes to the drawing board with a
      million ideas, always open-minded and never stubborn to adapt. He is a
      true team player, respecting others' opinions but, when necessary,
      offering powerful guidance that is rooted in a deep understanding of
      design principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mikael is multi-talented, experienced, and a pro through and through. Any

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      As a Marketing Manager having the privilege to work alongside Mikael
      Cedergren at Youcruit for the Lanefinder brand was an enriching experience
      that highlighted the impact of a truly visionary Senior Graphic Designer &
      Art Director. Mikael's multifaceted role, encompassing the translation of
      our brand guidelines into compelling visual stories and leading our design
      team, has been pivotal in defining the visual identity of Lanefinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      With over 15 years of diverse experience in marketing and technology,
      Mikael's deep knowledge within the Adobe Suite, Figma, and other design
      tools is unparalleled. His ability to breathe life into graphics,
      transforming them into interactive HTML for our website, showcases his
      unique blend of creativity and technical expertise. Mikael's leadership
      extends beyond project execution; he has been an inspiring mentor to
      junior team members, guiding them to excel in their roles with confidence
      and creativity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mikael's contribution to Youcruit transcends traditional design
      boundaries. He seamlessly integrated with the product team, enhancing the
      graphic interface of our tools while maintaining a strong presence in
      communication design. His strategic approach to design, ability to
      understand and implement briefs independently, and knack for overcoming
      challenges are commendable.
    </p>

    <p>
      On a personal note, Mikael's creativity is matched by his extraordinary
      spirit and resilience. His open-mindedness to feedback and ability to
      rebound with even more innovative ideas are traits that make him an
      invaluable team player. The office is brighter and more lively thanks to
      his unique stories and infectious enthusiasm.
    </p>

    <p>
      I wholeheartedly recommend Mikael to any organization in need of a
      seasoned Graphic Designer/Art Director. Whether as a senior member of a
      larger team or as a versatile one-man army for smaller companies, Mikael's
      blend of creative vision, technical skill, and positive energy will make a
      significant impact. His forward-thinking approach and commitment to
      excellence are rare finds, and I am confident he will continue to excel in
      his future endeavors.

    <p>
      In my experience working with Mikael, he was always up to get the job done
      and with a smile. He always had a can-do attitude and positive
      disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would voice his concerns in a productive manner, but always willing to
      be a team player. He has a fun personality and always up for a good laugh.
      He's creative, skilled and always willing to learn and grow.

    <p>He'd be an asset to any organization.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Mikael as a creator has an amazing eye for detail while also being able to
      retain the"big picture" needed for a campaign or brand. He can be an ideas
      guy and great at stimulating and steering brainstorming sessions in order
      to find new angles and approaches but he is also capable and confident in
      following an idea through to completion with the same enthusiasm and
      energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mikael is a vibrant addition to any team. As a colleague, he is warm,
      encouraging and can provide guidance from years of deep experience to
      junior team members. He is also just great to chat to! Mikael is and will
      be a wonderful asset to any team he works with.
