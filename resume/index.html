  <h1>Profile</h1>
  <p
    >With over 25 years of experience in Art Direction,
    Motion Graphics, and Graphic Design, I've crafted
    designs that leave a lasting impact across various
    platforms. My work spans from creating marketing
    materials for print and online to developing motion
    graphics for TV shows and ads, and building complete
    branding identities for numerous companies. </p
  ><p>
    My passion lies in creating visually compelling designs
    that deliver tangible results. Notably, my email designs
    have achieved conversion rates exceeding 13%, and my
    designs consistently yield significant outcomes in
    surveys. I thrive in both leadership and hands-on roles,
    driven by my love for creation. What sets me apart is my
    ability to approach ideas from a fresh perspective,
    meticulous attention to detail, and understanding of
    technical constraints, enabling effective communication
    across teams.</p
